# nhl

National Hockey League (NHL) stats as I like 'em.

`nhl` is a command line utility that fetches the current NHL standings, 
schedule, or current playoff matchups, and displays them in a table format 
in the command window.

Presently `nhl` can display the following things:

* NHL standings, in various ways
* NHL schedules, in various ways
* Playoff matchups, given the current standings

## Motivation

I want to see NHL standings that clearly show team rankings 
despite differences in games played.

I find ranking teams by points, as traditional in media, isn't
great because of discrepancies in games played.  Also some NHL 
games end up worth 3-points, and others just 2-points.  With the 
league running at about .550 win percentage, I feel it makes 
more sense to rank teams in terms of ***wins minus losses***.

**What's wrong with win percentage?**

Win percentage isn't universally available in NHL standings online,
and win percentage is never clear how many games separate two 
teams. With ***wins minus losses***, the number of games separating
teams is unambiguous.

## Quick start

```text
nhl            # NHL standings, 5 different ways
nhl -d         # NHL standings by division
nhl -c         # NHL standings by conference
nhl -f         # NHL league standings
nhl -l10       # NHL league standings by last 10 games
nhl -p         # NHL playoff matchups
nhl -s         # NHL schedule, including broadcasters, next 7 days
nhl -s -t MTL  # Full schedule including broadcasters and results for one team 
```

## Usage

### Version information with `-V` or `--version`

Here's the latest version:

<!-- BEGIN:version -->

```text
$ nhl -V

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:version -->

### Help information with `-h` or `--help`
<!-- BEGIN:help -->

```text
$ nhl -h

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:help -->

## Standings

All standings are assembled from results from the following call to the NHL api:

* https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/standings/now

### Default output of `nhl` is standings, sliced and diced

The default output is **standings** segmented segmented in different ways

* Four divisions standings,
* two conference standings, 
* full league standings, and
* Last 10 games performance.

Standings order are determined by

* wins minus losses (descending), 
* games played (ascending), and 
* regulation wins (descending).

The standings groups show

* GP — games played, 
* +/- wins minus losses, 
* L10 — and the last 10 games' wins minus losses,
* RW — number of regulation wins,
* GD — goal differential,
* +/- — goal differential, last 10 games.

Below each standings group is a tally of the columns in the group.

<!-- BEGIN:vanilla -->

```text
$ nhl 

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:vanilla -->

### Division standings with `--division` or `-d`

<!-- BEGIN:division -->

```text
$ nhl -d

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:division -->

### Conference standings with `--conference` or `-c`

<!-- BEGIN:conference -->

```text
$ nhl -c

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:conference -->

### Full league standings- `--full` or `-f`

#### Conventional full league standings

<!-- BEGIN:full -->

```text
$ nhl -f

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:full -->

#### Full league standings by last 10 games
<!-- BEGIN:last10 -->

```text
$ nhl --l10

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:last10 -->

### Playoff matchups with `--playoffs` or `-p`

Playoff matchups are derived from the current standings on a ***wins minus losses** basis.

Playoff matchups are followed by a list of proximate teams that are "on the outside, looking-in."

<!-- BEGIN:playoffs -->

```text
$ nhl -p

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:playoffs -->

## Schedules

### Current schedule segment (7-days) with `--schedule` or `-s`

The current schedule uses the following call to the NHL api:

* https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/schedule/now

Shows the next 7 days of NHL games (including today), strat times, and broadcast networks.

The output shows scores of games currently in progress, and scores of games very
recently completed.

<!-- BEGIN:schedule -->

```text
$ nhl -s

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:schedule -->

### Schedule for a particular team with (`--schedule` or `-s`) and (`--team <TEAM>` or `-t <TEAM>`)

The full-season team-specific schedule uses the following call to the NHL api, showing
the schedule for the Montreal Canadiens "MTL" and the 2025-2026 season.

* https://api-web.nhle.com/v1/club-schedule-season/MTL/20252026

<!-- BEGIN:teamschedule -->

```text
$ nhl -s -t MTL

./update-readme: line 20: ./target/release/nhl: Bad CPU type in executable
```

<!-- END:teamschedule -->
